Every enterprise is subject to many governmental and industry regulations, many of which regulate how data and information is used and managed. Part of the Data Governance Function is to:
This is a risk and audit responsibility; Data Governance plays no role in this
Perform ad-hoc audits of possible regulations to report to the DG Council on an information only basis
Enforce enterprise-wide mandatory compliance to regulations
This is about data, Data Governance is accountable for the whole process, with Risk and Audit reporting to DG
Monitor and ensure that organisations meet any regulatory compliance requirements

One of the difficulties when integrating multiple source systems is:
determining valid links or equivalences between data elements.
maintaining documentation describing the data warehouse operation.
completing the data architecture on time for the first release.
having a data quality rule applicable to all source systems.
modifying the source systems to align to the enterprise data model.

When defining your business continuity plan, which of the following should one consider doing?
Determine the risk, probability and impact, check document backup frequency
Consider written policies and procedures, impact mitigating measures, required recovery time and acceptable amount of disruption, the criticality of the documents
Write a report and discuss with management the required budget
Make sure that the data is retained sufficiently long, check that critical data is encrypted, check access rights
Have the contracts in place to acquire new hardware in case of technical problems, define policies

Metadata repository processes will not include:
Controlling versions of data product will be required to manage the required single published master copy in conjunction with the variants potentially established as work in progress.
Selecting Data Management Library software, search, and storage technologies
Managing change to data products (e.g. Data Dictionary or Business Data Glossary) entries e.g. new data term to be defined, new data requirement, new database tables added, new system included into the technical landscape.

Departmental data, regional data, and enterprise data.
Historical data, current data and future dated data.
Data element value, data instance or record, and data set.
Fine data, coarse data, and rough data.
Person data, location data, and product data.
